 I wrote this article because I took a sit back and I couldn't even remember anything from PHP aside the fact that I used a lot of dollar signs $$$. In this post, I will mostly be documenting in chronological order, the tools I learnt since I started programming. *(At least the ones I can remember)*

# Finding myself
 ## LOGO
 [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) programming was taught in early secondary school years as part of school curriculum. I remember drawing very basic shapes with LOGO. In fact, it felt more like maths than programming because we actually had to calculate angles and shape functions before actually drawing them. I was pretty good at maths and learning LOGO was cool. I'd say, it created a spark in me to learn more about programming.

 ## HTML / CSS 
 ![html css image](images/htmlcss.png)
 It was also compulsory to learn HTML in Computer Science in Junior School. The curriculum only actually covered basics, but my friends and I built some websites with HTML/CSS then. I remember building a download site that hosted all the images on my computer. The site was really bad, because I wrote all the pages by hand, copied and pasted blocks repeatedly. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was a very good guide to learn HTML and CSS.

 ## PHP 
 ![php image](images/php.png)
 There was a Wordpress workshop two years before I graduated from secondary school that actually ended abruptly, if I remember correctly. I dug the source code for most of the things and started learning PHP myself from a very scanty PHP manual. It was actually the only resource I had then, but at the time, it was enough.  
 PHP was the first programming language with which I practiced my knowledge of control flow and  flowcharts in programming.  
 Why did I stop PHP? **Python was starting to gain hype and I was advised to learn it by my Physics teacher.**

 ## Python 
 {{<figure src="images/py.png" align="center" height="200">}}
Unlike PHP, I was able to find a lot of resources on python. Python was actually very easy to learn for me. I used certain materials that I still recommend to people that have reached me to learn programming as a guide to learning python.
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart [link](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994)
- Beyond the Basics with Python by Al Sweigart [link](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/)
- *some material I can no longer find anywhere on the internet* // TODO: 
- Solved a lot of hacker rank problems with python
- Making games with Python and Pygame [link](https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf)  
I loved games a lot, so I was curious and very interested to learn the act of making one with my newly developed skill. Did I get heart broken? It took me sometimes to actually realise how unfit and very difficult it would be to make a game with pygame, even though it was fun to learn.

> It was at this point I chose to study Software Engineering instead of Medicine. I mean, it made sense because I was interested and curious mostly about programming and tech stuff.

# The Journey
## Git / Github and Version Control
|
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
{{< figure src="images/gh.png" alt="github logo" width="200" >}} |  {{<figure src="images/git.png" width="200" alt="git logo">}} 

I started using git and github very early and that is why I have a lot of repositories on github. I really cannot recall how I started using git and github but I started pretty early. This is good because, over time, I could share my progress with friends and keep track of changes on the projects I worked on. I also tried other repositories like Gitlab and Bitbucket, but I still prefer Github.

## Java / Android Development
|
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
{{< figure src="images/java.png" alt="java logo" width="200" >}} |  {{<figure src="images/android.png" width="200" alt="android logo">}}  

In my first year at the University of Lagos, I met a lot of friends and seniors who had interest in programming like I did. I joined Engineering Career Expo and learned Android development with Java. I still regard Java as my native language till date. I learnt a lot while learning Java and I think most things in Java made a lot of sense compared to the languages I have used previously. This dates back to 2018.

## JavaScript, Node and ExpressJS
{{<figure src="images/node.png" width="200">}}
I learnt backend web development with ExpressJS. This was the first ever server that I built, and I created and exposed endpoints that were consumed by the apps I was building at the time. I really never learnt Javascript actively, it just kind of clicked. I had to take some tutorials to learn ExpressJS on the other hand because the concepts of server and the whole backend was strange at the time.

## Flutter and Dart
{{<figure src="images/flutter.svg" width="200">}}
A friend recommended Flutter to me and I agreed to look into Flutter because it was built by Google and also because it promised to build cross-platform mobile applications. This meant that learning Flutter would actually make me write both Android and iOS apps, so I gave it a shot and it was a very long shot ðŸ˜‚ (because I still use it to date).
I immediately started using Flutter because:
- building UI is wayyy easier than building natively with Java
- I was using a 4gb ram lenovo laptop at the time and using Android Studio was a pain. (At least, I got to use vscode with Flutter).

## Java II
The funny thing was that I never really learned Java the first time. Yes! I built some applications with Java, but I was only focused on the Android Framework and never used Java for things like data structures and algorithms for example. I didn't even understand how many of the libraries I used, worked in-depth.  
In Kazan Federal University, Java was officially taught in-depth this time and I learnt super fast, because of my previous experience building Android applications. This time around, I learnt in-depth concepts ranging from data structures, algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Generics, Concurrency and Threading, Design patterns, Architectures, and so on.   
Java set the foundation to professional programming for me. I learnt a lot of things that I still use till date and I am happy I started with Java. Thing is, my choice of languages since Java has been influenced by the fact that I learnt Java first because I am more inclined to learn languages that are similar to Java.

---
> At this point, learning new languages has been breeze for me. I can learn a new language in less than a week or two, and I can build a simple application with it. I have learnt a lot of languages since then, but I will only be highlighting the ones I have used extensively.
---

## Kotlin
{{<figure src="images/kot.png" width="200">}}
I had a very short experience with Kotlin. I guess every Java developer must have tried some Kotlin at some time. I used Kotlin only for some Codeforces contest.

## PostgreSQL
{{<figure src="images/pg.webp" width="200">}}
NoSQL database was my bread and beans then. I used MongoDB and Firebase a lot. I actually knew some SQL before it was taught in school, but I never knew things like normalization and other relational db concepts.  PostgreSQL was reintroduced as a course in my second year and I went really deep into SQL concepts. Most importantly, I learnt how to use PostgreSQL with Java and I also learnt how to use it with Node.js. I used PostgreSQL for a lot of projects and I still use it to date.

## iOS Development (Swift / Objective-C)
{{<figure src="images/swift.png" height="200">}}
I picked iOS development as my technical area of specialty from my second year at the University to augment my Flutter skills with native development. I learnt extensively, iOS development with Swift and I can boast of middle level experience with Swift and iOS development.   
I also learnt Objective-C on my own, because I was curious to see how much of an improvement Swift was, when compared with Objective-C.  
I have built a lot of applications with Swift and some of them are available on my repo on [Github](https://github.com/lordvidex?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=swift&sort=).  
> I also had my second year summer internship with a company as an iOS developer.  

Before I move to other languages, I think Swift is one of the most properly designed programming languages I have used. Furthermore, I'll explain how iOS development was easy but complex at the same time:  
As a beginner, one is abstracted away from serious swift code and can use the Layout Builder to build a decent app in Xcode. When moving up the ladder and getting better, you have to do everything without the layout builder altogether and also learn about [ARC](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html) memory management model.  
Altogether, I really enjoyed iOS development, Xcode, and the Swift programming style guide. I think Swift is a very good language to learn for beginners and I recommend it to anyone that wants to learn programming practically.

## TypeScript 
{{<figure src="images/ts.png" height="200">}}
Finally, developers were starting to see what I saw wrong in Javascript. I jumped on the train when Typescript came on board and some of the projects I worked on, at [Paytrybe](https://paytrybe.com) were built with Typescript.  
Typescript is a very nice language and I always advice backend developers to check out [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). Nest is a progressive Node.js framework that uses Typescript and makes backend development a breeze. It utilises the power of decorators, generics, interfaces, dependency injection and many other OOP stuff and best practices, that JS was missing.  
If I had to build a LTS server in the shortest possible time, I'd use NestJS.

## Go
{{<figure src="images/go.png" height="200">}}
I started learning Go programming language in the summer of 2022 and my growth in the language has been extremely rapid. First, I learnt the syntax in less than two days, but I guess everyone has similar experiences learning Go because Go is a very simplistic and yet very powerful language. It's easy to get addicted to Go because it combines the best of many worlds. Currently, this is my *go-to* programming languge *(Sorry Java ðŸ« )*. I explained the reasons why I started learning Go here in [my other article.](https://lordvidex.live/posts/creating-go-cli/)  
Learning Go means that I had to learn about containerization, microservices, tooling and profiling.. Go is very fascinating, and there is so much to learn writing Go. I have built a lot of end user applications as well as open source libraries in Go. I have also contributed to several open source Go libraries. You can check them out in my [Github repo.](https://github.com/lordvidex?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go&sort=)

## Docker
{{<figure src="images/docker.png" width="200">}}
Docker! Docker!! Docker!!! These days, it's impossible to not see a post about Docker. I used Docker before Go, but I never saw the need for containerization until Go. I use Docker greatly for spinning up containers for integration testing, maintaining singular application environment / workflow and application deployment. In production, I also have some applications running on Docker swarm.

## Linux / Operating Systems
{{<figure src="images/linux.jpeg" height="200">}}
I took operating systems as a course in my third year in the university and we covered a lot of Unix specific concepts which includes Networking, File systems, security, containerization, etc. All of these concepts came in handy because I deployed most of my server instances on linux machines.

## Others
In no specific order, I'll like to name other concepts, popular architectural patterns that I appreciated, used and I think are notable mentions in my journey:
- MVC, MVVM architectural patterns in iOS / Android development.
- Clean Architecture, DDD, BLOC, Redux, TDD, animations in Flutter.
- SOLID principles, SPRING, Enterprise development in Java.
- Package Oriented Programming (POP), microservices, error handling, profiling and tooling, optimization, concurrency techniques, Docker, *(omg testingggg)* and other low level system stuffs in Go.


# Tips and Tricks to learning new languages
I cannot guarantee that my method will work for everyone, but I found out that since I already know most programming principles and techniques, all that is required to learn a new language is to learn the syntax and the language specifics. Hence I do the following:
- Check out the language on [learnxinyminutes.com](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
- Read the official documentation of the language.  
Some languages actually have very good documentation for example:
  - Swift releases a new version of The Swift Programming language ebook in the Books app on MacOS. [link](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
  - Go has a very good documentation on [go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/) as well as playgrounds.
  - Typescript as well [has a very good documentation.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- I solve some algorithms and data structure problems with the language to familiarise myself more with the language syntax and libraries. Personally, I use [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) to learn a new language.
- Finally and most importantly, reaching out to the community is the best way to learn a language, because you can ask questions and learn from the rich experience of developers that have been using the language for a long time. In fact, they can recommend the best materials to learn the language.
